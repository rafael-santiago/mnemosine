Mnemosine
---------

Description: A library which implements a pre-allocated heap scheme.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

Sometimes you need the heap, however, you also need to avoid the overhead of occupying the
operating system with tons of allocations and deallocations. Using a simpler pre-allocated
heap ***may*** help you on speeding up your stuff.

Mnemosine seeks to implement a well-simple heap scheme with simple and straightforward
memory management algorithm. It creates a dedicated (maybe global) memory pool to your
application.

You can easily use it under: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Minix, Solaris and Windows.

How should I build it?
----------------------

Mnemosine build is based on a tool of mine called Hefesto [https://github.com/rafael-santiago/hefesto].
Once this tool well-installed just enter into src subdirectory of Mnemosine and call Hefesto from there.

The ar file libmnemosine.a will be created at ../lib. Use it to link your stuff.

The Mnemosine build is well-simple. There are only two relevant user's build options:

    - '--no-mutexes' (This is the default, any synchronization will be applied during
                      allocations and deallocations)

    - '--no-pthread' (It will make Mnemosine thread unsafe on Unixes)

    - '--mnemosine-static-heap-size=<n>' (The maximum size of the static buffer used as heap.
                                          This number is interpreted as n megabytes.
                                          The default is 5MB)

How should I use it?
--------------------

Mnemosine try to be as suckless [https://suckless.org/philosophy] as possible. Thus, all you should do
is to include the mnemosine.h header file and every feature will be accessible to you.

Before starting use Mnemosine into your program you need to initialize it through the function
mnemosine_init().

The init function expects three arguments:

    - A pointer to struct mnemosine_ctx.
    - The pre-allocated heap size.
    - The flag use_mnheap (When 1 it will use the static buffer which the size was configured during the
                           library build, otherwise it will allocate a buffer with the requested size.
                           Note that when using the internal static buffer you are limited to the maximum
                           configured size. When using the internal static buffer the memory pool will be
                           global).

In terms of code it would be:

    #include <mnemosine.h>

    ...

    struct mnemosine_ctx mn;

    ...

    if (!mnemosine_init(&mn, 4096, 0)) {
        printf("ERROR: unable to create the internal heap.\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    ...

The second argument related to size is expressed in bytes. Anyway, you can use three nice Mnemosine
macros that can help you on simplifying the heap size definition:

    - mnemosine_size_kb(n)

    - mnemosine_size_mb(n)

    - mnemosine_size_gb(n)

The above mnemosine_init() call could become more expressive in the following way:

    if (!mnemosine_init(&mn, mnemosine_size_kb(4), 0)) {
        ...
    }

Once initialized you will use two functions. A function for memory allocation and a function for
memory deallocation.

To allocate memory you call:

    void *mnemosine_malloc(struct mnemosine_ctx *mn, size_t ssize);

To deallocate memory you call:

    int mnemosine_free(struct mnemosine_ctx *mn, void *addr);

The mnemosine_free() function when actually deallocates return 1. When it returns 0 it means that
the passed pointer is not within the pre-allocated heap segment range. This is useful when you has
integrated Mnemosine with your custom allocator. So you start using mnemosine_malloc(), when there
is not enough memory in the Mnemosine's heap it will return NULL and you can try to get memory in a
slower way (regular malloc() as instance), so if the passed pointer was not freed by mnemosine_free()
it should be freed by the regular free() function.

The mnemosine_malloc() function always returns zeroed memory segments.

The context expected by those functions is the same used during the mnemosine_init() call [duh!].

After using mnemosine into your program you should deinitialize it just by calling:

    mnemosine_finis(struct mnemosine_ctx *mn)

The context expected is the same used during the mnemosine_init() [duh!].

... and we done here. Now you are a PhD on it, congrats! Bye!
